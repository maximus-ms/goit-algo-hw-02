## GoITNeo Algo HW-2

### Task 1: Queue
You need to develop a program that simulates the reception and processing of requests:
 - the program should automatically generate new requests (identified by a unique number or other data)
 - add them to a queue
 - remove them from the queue for 'processing'

thus simulating the operation of a service center.

### Task 2: Deque
You need to develop a function that takes a string as an input parameter, adds all its characters to a double-ended queue (deque from the collections module in Python), and then compares the characters from both ends of the queue to determine if the string is a palindrome. The program should correctly handle both even and odd-length strings, as well as be case-insensitive and insensitive to spaces.
